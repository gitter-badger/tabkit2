## Introduction
The original [Tab Kit(TK)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/tab-kit/) is an extension of Firefox that many people are using.  
It was last updated September 26, 2010, and the author has been silent after that.  
The most updated version (0.6) is not compatible with FF4+, since FF3->4 has a HUGE change especially in tab bar DOM structure.

This project aims to change modify the original TK to make it FF4+ compatible (and drop the support for pre-FF4).  
The name for the new(not quite) extension is *Tab Kit 2nd Edition*(You can still call it *Tab Kit 2* or *TK2* for short)

# Project Helper Needed!
I am working starting from 23 July, 2012  
So that means I have almost no time for maintaining Tab Kit  
I need someone to help me!

## Collaboration
Since we are on GitHub  
Just fork, change and send pull request  
I will check frequently (since I also use GitHub at work)

## Download from Mozilla Addon Site if possible  
The one on their site is reviewed  
But if it's not the latest version, then use the Github one :P

## Compatibility with other extensions

- Firebug: Incompatible  
(But it seems OK since Fx10 o_0)

## Compatibility with new features in Fx4+
  - TabsOnTop: Works fine on horizontal mode, no effect on vertical mode
  - App/Pin Tabs: Use it at your own risk, no support provided
  - Tab Groups: Disabled

### False incompatibility with newer Firefox
Summary:  
If newer Firefox say it is incompatible, install one of the following:  
- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-on-compatibility-reporter/
- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/checkcompatibility/

But it should not be a problem since Fx 12
